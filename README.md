Blockchain-Based Fraud Detection System 🚀💳
Welcome to the Blockchain-based Fraud Detection System! This system uses AI, Machine Learning, and Blockchain technologies to predict and detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. The system can flag suspicious activities and provide an alert to prevent financial fraud.

🚀 Features:
Blockchain Integration: Uses Ethereum for real-time transaction monitoring.
AI & ML: Trains models to detect fraud based on transaction data.
Real-time Predictions: Identifies fraudulent transactions on the go.
🛠️ Requirements:
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v14 or higher) – Download from Node.js official website
npm (Node Package Manager) – Comes with Node.js installation
Python (v3.7 or higher) – Download from Python official website
Git (for version control) – Download Git here
React.js – Install React.js
⚡ Project Setup:
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
2️⃣ Install Backend Dependencies:
Go to the backend folder and install the required packages.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
npm install
This will install the following key dependencies:

Express: Server framework for handling HTTP requests.
Web3: Ethereum API for interacting with the blockchain.
TensorFlow.js: For machine learning models.
scikit-learn: For Python-based AI/ML models.
axios: HTTP request library.
3️⃣ Install Frontend Dependencies:
Go to the frontend folder and install the necessary dependencies.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm install
This will install all the libraries required to run the React frontend.

🏃‍♂️ Running the Project:
1️⃣ Start the Backend Server:
Go to the backend folder and start the server.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
node app.js
This will start your server at http://localhost:5000. It will listen for incoming requests for fraud detection and blockchain-related operations.

2️⃣ Start the Frontend Server:
Go to the frontend folder and start the React application.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm start
The frontend will be live at http://localhost:3000. The page should show a button that, when clicked, allows users to enter transaction details (e.g., amount, sender address, receiver address). The app will then send the data to the backend for fraud prediction.

💡 Key Functionality:
1️⃣ Blockchain Integration:
The Backend uses the Web3 library to connect to the Ethereum blockchain (using Infura) to check transaction details.
Blockchain transaction data can be used to verify sender/receiver addresses and balances.
2️⃣ Fraud Prediction:
Machine Learning Models are trained on historical transaction data to predict fraudulent transactions based on the input received from the frontend.
The backend handles prediction using a simple scikit-learn model in Python that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
🔧 Troubleshooting:
Common Issues:
Server Not Starting:

Ensure that both the backend and frontend have all required dependencies installed.
Make sure you are in the correct directory (either frontend or backend) when running the commands.
If you get errors related to missing dependencies, run npm install again in the respective folder.
Infura Connection:

Ensure that you've correctly set up the Infura Project ID in the backend (app.js) file.
Go to Infura to create an account and generate your own Project ID for Ethereum.
🧠 Advanced Features:
Improving Fraud Detection:

You can improve the machine learning model by training it with more real-world data to make it more accurate.
You could experiment with different types of models (e.g., deep learning) for fraud prediction.
Expand Blockchain Integration:

Connect the system to more blockchains to increase compatibility with other platforms (e.g., Binance Smart Chain, Polygon).
Add features like smart contract auditing to identify suspicious contract activities.
